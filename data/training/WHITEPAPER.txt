1.0 Introduction
1.1 The CipheX Ecosystem 
CipheX is a dynamic community platform where token holders can access advanced institutional-grade 
trading and risk management strategies powered by the Abacus Network. This system delivers 
automated, 24/7 market returns while enabling token holders to participate in additional long-term 
growth opportunities shaped by the CipheX community.

1.2 The Origin of CipheX 
Originally called the Hypatia Analytics (Hypatia), the system was originally designed by Cipherion 
Market Research to analyze fractal volatility characteristics and certain nonlinear market behaviors in 
traditional capital markets to produce identifiable trading opportunities. Recognizing the unique 
opportunities within the cryptocurrency sector—driven by high volatility and rapid growth—Hypatia
was reengineered to prioritize autonomous market execution opportunities across all cryptocurrency 
asset classes. Hypatia was divided into two specialized systems for development and operational 
efficiency: Abacus Analytics (Abacus) and Market Centurions (Centurions). Abacus functions as 
the neural center, integrating high-speed connectivity, quantitative machine learning, and generative 
AI to produce advanced graphical adaptive predictability models that identify optimal trading 
strategies within the cryptocurrency markets. These strategies are then executed by Centurions,
automated trading bots operating as a coordinated system (collectively referred to as the “Abacus 
Network”).

1.3 Autonomous Market Trading
Market Centurions can outperform traditional automated trading bots by symbiotically integrating
their neural network with the Abacus neural center. This collaboration allows Centurions to 
dynamically adapt to sudden market shifts to generate a consistent range of favorable probabilities 
across diverse risk scenarios, even when diverging from Abacus-generated strategies. These real-time 
adjustments are relayed back to Abacus, enabling the creation of advanced predictive models—termed 
derivative strategies—that further refine and enhance the performance of existing trading approaches.

1.4 The Future of CipheX 
CipheX transforms traditional financial management by providing individuals unparalleled access to 
institutional-grade, AI-driven trading strategies through the Abacus Network. Utilizing advanced 
analytics and automation, CipheX bridges the gap between sophisticated market opportunities and 
everyday investors, ensuring financial growth and accessibility for anyone, regardless of experience or 
background. Beyond trading, CipheX is dedicated to creating a global ripple effect of innovation and 
economic progress. With a focus on unlocking potential in emerging markets and undervalued 
industries, CipheX empowers its Community to invest in transformative sectors such as alternative 
healthcare, sustainable agriculture, and entrepreneurial ventures that stimulate local economies and 
generate long-term societal benefits. By reimagining decentralized finance with simplicity and 
transparency, CipheX is set to introduce peer-to-peer lending solutions designed for both commercial 
and individual needs. These future lending solutions are designed to deliver cost-effective, secure, and 
efficient financing, breaking down the prohibitive barriers of traditional financial systems.

1.5 Road Map Overview
Phase I. Key development activities for launching the CipheX Community include preparing targeted 
marketing strategies for its public presale campaign ("PreSale"). During Phase 2 and 3, CipheX targets
its launch on the Uniswap decentralized exchange by mid-2025, alongside additional commercial 
testing of the Abacus Network. CipheX anticipates a full rollout later in 2025. For Phase 4., CipheX 
anticipates listing on a centralized exchange in 2026, enhancing market accessibility for the CipheX 
Community. Additionally, CipheX plans to launch its investment services and P2P lending programs to 
support emerging markets and undervalued industry sectors. In addition, CipheX plans to focus on 
expanding commercial opportunities for the Abacus Network during Phase 5. CipheX expects to 
pursue additional market opportunities for its investment and P2P lending services. It targets
additional listings on multiple centralized exchanges throughout 2027, enhancing market value and 
investor accessibility for the CipheX Community.

2.0 Tokenomics
2.1 CipheX Maximum Supply
CipheX has set a maximum supply of 1.5 billion CPX Tokens, structured with a deflationary model to 
gradually reduce the total supply over ten years. This deflationary approach, market stabilization 
efforts, and expected growth is expected to reduce price volatility, and support sustained long-term 
value.
(Table 2.1A – CPX Distributed Allocation)

5 Page |
2.2 Creator & Founder Tokens 
Creator and Founding Contributor tokens ("Creator Tokens") are secured in two smart contracts. The 
first contract locks 80% of CPX Tokens for two years, with releases based only on achieving 
distributable profits for the CipheX Community. The second contract secures the remaining 20% of 
Creator Tokens under the same lockup and vesting terms as other CPX Token holders.
(Table 2.1A – Creators & Founding Contributor Locked CPX Tokens)

2.3 Treasury Management
CipheX uses multi-sig authentication protocols to manage CPX Tokens or digital currency transfers
from treasury or capital wallets of the CipheX Community (Treasury Management). The independent 
oversight of Expert Contributors further governs this multi-layered approval system. These Treasury 
Management protocols increase transparency and accountability, further safeguarding the CipheX 
Community from single points of failure, potential misconduct, or theft.
(Table 2.2A – Treasury Management Protocol of CPX Tokens)

2.4 PreSale of CPX Tokens
The PreSale anticipates driving awareness through extensive online media campaigns and partnering 
with established marketing firms and key opinion leaders. In addition, CipheX will introduce its 
marketing affiliate and referral program designed to incentivize PreSale contributors to earn rewards 
by referring friends and networks. 
The CipheX PreSale is expected to open under the following terms:
• Start Price Per CPX: $0.10 (Ten Cents)
• Minimum CPX Tokens: 2000 CPX (n1)
• Maximum CPX Tokens: 200,000 (n1)
• Target Funding: $20,000,000 (n2)
• Minimum Funding: $2,000,000 (n3)
• Planned Duration: 180 Days
Notes: (n1) CipheX accepts USDT, USDC, and ETH for CPX Token contributions. There are minimum and maximum 
limits on the number of CPX Tokens that can be acquired per contribution. (n2) 142,738,450 CPX Tokens are 
allocated for the PreSale phase. (n3) The PreSale has a Minimum Funding requirement. Suppose CipheX does not 
meet this threshold within the first 90 days of the PreSale. In that case, all contributions will be returned to 
contributors (minus any network transfer fees), and the PreSale will be closed.

2.5 Automated Daily Pricing 
During the PreSale, the price of CPX Tokens is set to increase every 24 hours. The PreSale is anticipated 
to remain open 180 days from its start date, with automated daily price increases designed to generate 
unrealized gains for contributors. The estimated final price at the close of the PreSale is projected to 
reach $0.2593, representing an unrealized gain of approximately 159.93% from the opening price.
(Table 2.5A – Estimated Unrealized Gains of CPX Tokens during PreSale)

7 Page |
2.6 Costs of PreSale Activities
If the CipheX Community successfully achieves the target funding during its planned PreSale, total 
expenditures are projected at approximately $3,079,477. Affiliates include Key Opinion Leaders 
(KOLs) and marketing partners incentivized through a tiered payout structure to reward higher 
contributions. Affiliate payouts will follow a 50/50 split: 50% in USDT and 50% in CPX Tokens, valued 
at the time of each referred contribution. These payouts will commence after the minimum funding 
threshold is met. Should the minimum threshold not be achieved, no payouts will be distributed to 
Affiliates.
(Table 2.6A – Estimated Costs to Development and Marketing of PreSale)

2.7 Planned Use of Proceeds
CipheX has outlined a structured allocation of Target Funding from its PreSale to ensure healthy 
liquidity and essential operating capital to complete the development of decentralized governance 
features for its Community and commercialize the Abacus Network. 
(Table 2.7A – Estimated Use of Proceeds from its PreSale)

8 Page |
(Table 2.7B – Capital Management Protocol – Use of Proceeds)

2.8 CPX Lockup Restrictions
Except for CPX Tokens issued during the lockup earning period, all other CPX Tokens are subject to a 
six-month lockup and twelve-month vesting period. The lockup starts at distribution or PreSale 
contribution, during which tokens earn fixed returns based on the 10-year US Treasury yield. Paid as 
unrestricted CPX Tokens, these returns can be claimed after the PreSale. For tokens entering lockup 
post-PreSale, earned unrestricted CPX Tokens are distributed monthly.
(Table 2.8A – Estimated Total Locked CPX Tokens)

9 Page |
(Table 2.8B – Six Month Lockup – Sample Earn Rate on Total Locked CPX Tokens)
Notes Table 2.8B: (n1) Estimated total CPX Tokens subject to the six-month lockup (assumes Expert Contributors 
totaling 148,089,674 are fully allocated for modeling purposes). (n2) Fixed rate of return is based on the 10-year 
US Treasury yield at the start of each lockup. This yield is the effective rate for the six-month lockup period, 
doubling the 10-year US Treasury yield. The exact rate may vary based on the start date of each lockup period, and 
(n3) The fixed rate of return is calculated based on the total number of CPX Tokens, not on the market value of 
each token.

2.9 CPX Vesting Schedule
Except for Creator Tokens, CPX Tokens will automatically enter a one-year vesting schedule once their
six-month lockup period ends. In the first month, 3% of CPX Tokens will vest and become unrestricted, 
followed by increasing monthly release rates until all CPX Tokens are fully vested within 12 months. 

2.10 Fixed Term Staking and Rewards
The CipheX Fixed Term Staking program (CPX Staking) lets CPX Token holders lock tokens for 6, 12, 
or 24 months to earn CPX rewards. Launching after the PreSale, it offers fixed returns tied to the 10-
year US Treasury yield plus a premium, with rates set per staking period and varying by term and 
deposit size. For 12 months after the PreSale, CipheX will allow restaking in the program before 
gradually transitioning to liquidity staking incentives. 

2.11 Fixed Term Staking Redemptions
CPX Staking participants may end their term early and withdraw their principal CPX Tokens. However,
an early redemption incurs a penalty: forfeiture of any remaining returns and a redemption fee applied 
from the month of withdrawal before the monthly payout.

3.0 Community Management

3.1 Hybrid Organizational Model

3.2 Operating Capital Reserves
CipheX expects sufficient capital to cover daily operations, retain Expert Contributors, and support 
product research, development, and marketing. A portion of revenue from the Abacus Network and 
future services will be reserved as working capital and distributed with community approval. If mid_xfffe_year adjustments are needed, members can propose a reallocation vote to address urgent or evolving 
needs, ensuring sufficient funding to meet the needs of the Community.

3.3 Investment Participation
CipheX Community members have full control over their returns. CipheX investment opportunities, 
such as venture projects and lending services, are reviewed by elected Expert Contributors and require 
Community approval before listing. Members independently select projects to invest in, acknowledging 
associated risks beforehand. CipheX does make or manage investments for members.

3.4 Distribution of Returns
Profits from Abacus Network and future services are collected and entered into their revenue vault, 
which is managed by a transparent smart contract. Members can track the accrued value of market_xfffe_generated returns and revenue from services on their community dashboard. Distributions approved by the CipheX Community are transferred directly to member wallets at the end of each year. CipheX is non-custodial and does not manage or host capital or asset deposits for members. CipheX operates as a non-custodial platform, meaning it does not hold or manage members' capital or assets. Instead, members retain full control and independently manage their funds.

11 Page |
3.5 Creators & Founding Contributors
CipheX is a decentralized platform, ensuring that no single person or entity maintains majority control 
over its Community or capital. Each Creator and Founding Contributor brings over 25 years of proven 
expertise in cryptocurrency mining, cryptographic development, quantitative market analysis, capital 
markets trading, structure finance, portfolio and asset management, and executive leadership.

3.6 General and Expert Contributors
Expert Contributors appointed to key roles, such as Independent Governance or Market Research and 
Development teams, are elected or nominated by CipheX Community members. These positions carry 
a term of up to two years, after which contributors may be nominated for re-election. In contrast, 
General Contributors for community activities such as marketing and technical services are not elected 
by the CipheX Community, as these roles are often short-term. Instead, General Contributors are 
appointed with the approval of relevant Expert Contributors.

3.7 Market Performance Rewards
CipheX anticipates introducing annual Market Performance-based Rewards (MPR) within the first year 
of community operations, issued in unrestricted CPX Tokens. Eligible participants include Creators, 
Founding Contributors, and General and Expert Contributors who contribute directly to generating 
market returns and revenue from future services. This compensation rewards model ensures that 
investor returns are prioritized, with investors always receiving payment before MPR participants.

3.8 Removals and Termination
General Contributors may be removed for non-performance or voluntarily exiting before completing 
tasks. In either case, allocated CPX Tokens are revoked and returned to the CipheX treasury. Creators 
and Founding Contributors are exempt from direct community removal. However, they can be subject 
to peer removal if two-thirds approve a petition. This petition is then submitted to the CipheX 
Community for ratification, excluding the targeted member from voting. Upon ratification, smart 
contracts execute a buyback of unvested or undistributed CPX Tokens at market value within 30 days. 
If the buyback fails, the petition is voided, and the individual retains all rights and benefits.

3.9 Eligibility for Community Voting
CipheX will implement governance contracts using ERC20-based voting and consensus mechanisms, 
empowering community members to vote on proposals proportional to their CPX Token holdings. 
Token holders with at least 2,000 CPX Tokens are eligible to participate, with each token representing 
one vote. 

3.10 CPX Token Buyback Program
CipheX will implement the ability of the Community to initiate a buyback-and-burn program to 
repurchase CPX Tokens at a fixed price, reducing investment risk for token holders and improving 
liquidity. Funded by surplus capital, the program will not affect innovation or future investments. 
Community approval is required to initiate the program, and participation is optional for CPX Token 
holders.

12 Page |
3.11 Total Supply Burn Program
CipheX's tokenomics strategy is designed to reduce the maximum total supply of CPX Tokens by 
approximately 95% over the next decade. This process, executed via smart contracts within 30 days of 
each announcement, operates automatically without requiring a community vote, decreasing the 
token's maximum supply.
(Table 3.11A – Planned Reduction of CipheX Maximum Supply)

4.0 Performance Benchmarks

4.1 CipheX Revenue Streams
CipheX has identified three revenue sources for its Community: (a) Cryptocurrency market trading
activities, (b) Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) from venture capital investments in emerging markets and
undervalued industry sectors, and (c) strategic partnerships for decentralized P2P credit services for
small to mid-sized businesses. Over time, CipheX anticipates these revenue streams will produce
additional long-term opportunities for the CipheX Community.

4.2 Market Returns and Revenue Growth
CipheX anticipates that, during the first five years, its revenues will primarily be driven by
Cryptocurrency trading activities conducted by its Abacus Network. As the CipheX Community
increases earnings, investments are planned to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, venture-focused 
initial coin offerings (ICOs), and derivative revenues generated by Abacus Network and future services. 
These diversified revenue streams are expected to develop progressively over this initial five-year 
period.

13 Page |
(Table 4.2A – Anticipated Concentration of Revenue within the first 5 Years)
Over the next five to ten years, CipheX expects to expand peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services and
consumer usage fees from the Abacus Network to achieve increased market adoption. This growth is 
anticipated to boost revenue and strengthen returns for the CipheX Community. CipheX believes 
adoption will accelerate due to its strategy of delivering these services through strategic partnerships 
rather than developing new business models. 
(Table 4.2B – Anticipated Concentration of Revenue within 5 to 10 Years)

4.3 Scalable Growth and Efficiency
CipheX's market activities are powered by highly automated systems designed to scale efficiently with 
minimal human intervention. Manual oversight is required only for regular maintenance, system 
enhancements, or emergency events, allowing for continuous, 24/7 capacity adjustments that optimize 
market opportunities. By the third year, CipheX expects significant market traction driven by technical 
advancements and increased automation, largely independent of traditional administrative functions.

Notes: (n1) Estimated Revenue from Market Activities and future services, with EYE1 beginning upon the full 
operational launch of the Abacus Network; (n2) For this summary, CipheX includes investments in Non-Liquid 
Assets (NLA), primarily focusing on Venture ICOs and P2P Lending services. Each NLA investment is intended to 
be monetized over a five-to-ten-year horizon, with allocations for annual follow-on or future NLA investments 
capped at 5.5% of total revenue, contingent upon CipheX Community approval; and (n3) Related fees, including 
market trading and service fees associated with P2P Lending and Venture ICO investments.

Notes:(n1) Anticipated R&D and innovation development for the Abacus Network, with estimated average annual 
expenditures allocated as follows: 50% for Abacus, 30% for Market Centurions, and 20% for broader development 
and innovation; (n2) General operations are projected to average around 11.68% annually with 31.52% of the 
annual average directed toward Expert and General Contributors and 68.48% toward General Operating expenses 
to support technical infrastructure and CipheX Community activities; (n3) Earnings Before Interest and Taxes 
(EBIT) are expected to be pre-tax earnings distributable to the CipheX Community, less any proposed capital 
allocations approved by the CipheX Community to increase Abacus Network activities, maintain operations and
expand services.

5.0 Market Risk Factors
5.1 Market/Economic Volatility
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, with prices that can change rapidly and dramatically. 
The success of the CipheX Community will largely depend on the proprietary algorithms of the 
Abacus Network, which generate returns for the CipheX Community. Investors should know the 
cryptocurrency market is a high-risk trading environment, and Abacus Network strategies may 
sometimes result in losses. 
5.2 Autonomous Trading
Autonomous trading bots in cryptocurrency markets can add extra volatility if not managed 
properly. While these bots are expected to capitalize on market inefficiencies, they do not 
guarantee profits. If the Abacus Network algorithms misinterpret market conditions, Centurions
may respond unpredictably, potentially leading to significant financial losses.
5.3 Cybersecurity Threats
Cyberattacks, hacking, and security breaches can lead to theft and a decline in market trust. 
Although CipheX implements top-tier security protocols, the risk of unauthorized access to the 
CipheX ecosystem, Ethereum blockchain, and DEX assets remains. There is no guarantee that these 
security risks can be entirely prevented.
5.4 Liquidity/Price Volatility
Certain cryptocurrencies, particularly newer or lesser-known tokens, can experience low liquidity, 
making it challenging to buy or sell assets at preferred prices or within short timeframes. There 
are no assurances that the CipheX Community can maintain strong liquidity or that demand for 
CPX Tokens will continue to grow. 
5.5 Operational Risks
Blockchain networks and trading platforms depend on technology that can sometimes experience 
unexpected issues, outages, or software bugs. Additionally, CipheX relies on Expert Contributors 
for specific development and operational roles. If these Expert Contributors choose to leave or 
cannot complete their tasks, it could lead to significant disruption in the operations of the CipheX 
Community.
16 Page |
5.6 Fraud and Scam Risks
CipheX may invest in other cryptocurrency or tokenization projects. However, the crypto market 
is known for fraudulent schemes, such as phishing scams, Ponzi schemes, and misleading projects 
that exploit investors. While CipheX uses experienced contributors to perform assessments and 
thorough due diligence, there is no guarantee that some projects may be fraudulent.
5.7 Contract Vulnerabilities
Smart contracts are designed to enable and automate transactions within a decentralized, trustless 
environment. However, they carry certain risks, including potential coding errors, unforeseen 
vulnerabilities, or malicious exploits. Such failures may result in unexpected user losses, including 
token loss, trade disruptions, or other unintended financial outcomes. No system is entirely 
invulnerable to attacks or errors. 
5.8 Privacy and Data Risks
CipheX uses third party technologies and services to safeguard member identities. However, 
blockchain transactions are not fully private and information on public blockchains can be 
analyzed to reveal user identities and transaction histories, compromising privacy. While CipheX 
is committed to protecting member privacy, there is no guarantee that these privacy measures will 
be effective indefinitely.
5.9 Market Manipulation
Cryptocurrency markets, particularly those with lower liquidity, are vulnerable to manipulation 
tactics such as pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, and insider trading. Coordinated groups 
may also attempt community hijacking by gaining control over key protocols or liquidity, 
potentially distorting market prices, trading volumes, and governance decisions. These activities 
can create misleading market conditions that disadvantage regular investors and may result in 
financial loss and compromise the integrity of the CipheX Community. 
5.10 Risk of Natural Disasters
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires can impact the CipheX
Community and those of its service providers and counterparties. These events may lead to power 
outages, internet service interruptions, and physical damage to critical infrastructure, including 
data centers and mining facilities. Such disruptions can result in transaction processing delays, 
decreased network security, and potential financial losses for traders and investors who cannot
access markets during critical periods.
