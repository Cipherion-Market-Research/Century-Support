1.0 CipheX Ecosystem
1.1 The Problem
Traditional crypto trading exposes everyday investors to significant risk, often driven by emotion, speculation, and unpredictable market swings. Retail traders and everyday investors frequently make impulsive decisions, buying into the hype, panic-selling during downturns, or misjudging market trends. For example, in 2021, Bitcoin surged to $69,000, only to crash below $20,000 in 2022, wiping out billions in investments. Studies show that over 80% of day traders lose money consistently. In crypto, extreme price volatility, amplified by millions of users relying more on automated trading bots, can trigger rapid market swings and liquidations within seconds. 
While institutional traders leverage advanced algorithms, larger capital pools, and teams with years of experience to manage these movements, everyday investors are often left vulnerable, relying on limited tools, incomplete data, and emotional decisions. The rise of automated trading has created an uneven playing field, where retail investors are at a growing disadvantage. Without access to professional-grade risk management and automation, they are left vulnerable in financial markets that are becoming more dominated by high-frequency trading supported by AI-driven strategies.
1.2 The CipheX Mission
Managing a crypto portfolio shouldn't be complicated. CipheX believes financial independence should be accessible to everyone without costly advisors or institutional fees. CipheX is a sophisticated ecosystem that provides AI-driven trading automation and actionable insights to simplify complex markets, helping everyday investors understand market behavior and confidently manage their crypto portfolios based on strategy, not speculation, making crypto investing an easy, safer, and more rewarding experience.
1.3 Crypto Markets Simplified
Investing is a discipline, not a gamble. Successful long-term investors use data-driven decisions to manage risk and probability with strategy and discipline, focusing on consistent results rather than hype or speculation. CipheX empowers everyday investors with institutional-grade risk management and precision trading strategies, once reserved for hedge funds and professional traders, without the complexity or need for extensive financial market or trading experience.
CipheX delivers this through its Centurion Network, an advanced AI-powered system built on over 30 years of hands-on financial expertise. Centurions proactively analyzes market trends in real-time to manage portfolios 24/7, embedding decades of real-world expertise into every strategy, unlike other platforms that leave risk entirely on the user. With CipheX, everyday investors can define financial goals, automate or refine recommended strategies based on real-time market events, and authorize their Centurions to execute trade opportunities with precision and optimized performance. 
Imagine Centurions as your AI-powered team of expert financial managers and traders, working around the clock to monitor markets, manage risk, and strategically grow your crypto portfolio, free from emotion or guesswork. With CipheX Centurions, retail traders, and everyday investors no longer struggle against the dominance of automated market forces. Instead, they gain access to the same cutting-edge trading capabilities as professionals, ensuring precise execution, managed risk, and confident portfolio management, even in the most volatile conditions.
1.4 Centurion Market Advantage
Traditional trading platforms overwhelm new users with complexity, requiring technical expertise and financial knowledge to operate, let alone efficiently navigate volatile markets. Even with tutorials, explainer videos, and well-crafted guides, the learning curve often remains too steep for everyday individuals who lack the time or inclination to master intricate trading mechanics, resulting in costly mistakes or becoming discouraged and avoiding trading altogether. 
Meanwhile, conventional trading bots often require technical expertise to set up and operate, relying on rigid algorithms with fixed parameters. This rigidity causes them to miss profitable opportunities and struggle to adapt to sudden market shifts, leaving everyday investors disadvantaged and exposed to unnecessary risks, inefficiencies, and unpredictable losses.
The Centurion Network transforms crypto trading using multi-layered AI architecture, integrating machine learning, quantitative analysis, and behavioral market modeling arrangements to dynamically identify opportunities across all crypto markets, optimize portfolios, and execute trades efficiently. Unlike static trading bots, Centurions also uses variations of fractal volatility models to analyze price patterns across different timeframes, detecting micro indicators of market shifts before they become obvious to the broader market. 
In addition, with integrated dynamic risk management, Centurions continuously adjusts trade strategies in real-time, responding to economic signals, liquidity shifts, and volatility. By aggregating multi-market liquidity, arbitrage, and automated hedging strategies, Centurions effectively mitigates risk while capitalizing on market inefficiencies, ensuring optimized portfolio performance.
With 360-degree market intelligence, Centurions analyzes both on-chain and off-chain data to produce adaptive probability arrangements related to liquidity shifts and algorithmic market signals. It can provide users with real-time risk alerts and trade recommendations and automate portfolio adjustments based on market conditions while maintaining their financial goals. These actionable insights eliminate errors caused by poor human execution, incomplete information, or emotional decision-making. With CipheX Centurions, retail traders, and everyday investors can navigate volatile markets with confidence, precision, and strategic advantage.
1.5 The CipheX Roadmap
Phase I. Y2025. 
Phase I of the token distribution ran for 30 to 60 days, with limited contributions to refine CipheX's ecosystem, distribution platform, and marketing strategy in a live environment before opening the distribution to all contributors. Based on community feedback, CipheX launched a "View Only" version of the Centurion Network, demonstrating its analytics and autonomous trading capabilities as real-world proof of concept.
Phase II. EY2025. 
Phase II expands the AI infrastructure of its Centurion Network and offers exclusive limited pre-commercial access to token contributors. As the token distribution concluded, CipheX prepared for its Uniswap DEX listing, ensuring a streamlined market entry and establishing initial liquidity.
Phase III. EY2026.  
Phase III marks the commercial launch of the Centurion Network, with a focus on scalability and efficiency. CipheX expects to introduce its first Real World Asset (RWA) services, integrating autonomous digital asset management with real-world financial services to expand opportunities and market adoption. Additionally, CipheX will transition from Uniswap DEX to its first centralized exchange (CEX), enhancing market access and liquidity.
Phase IV. EY2027 and EY2028.  
Phase IV focuses on revenue growth and market expansion for the Centurion Network and RWA services while driving competitive innovations and strategic partnerships to enhance efficiency and profitability. As CipheX scales, it plans to expand to multiple CEXs, further increasing market accessibility and liquidity for its community.
2.0 Tokenomics
2.1 CipheX Maximum Supply
2.2 Creator & Founder Tokens 
Creator and Founding Contributor Tokens ("Creator Tokens") are secured in two smart contracts, with 80% locked for two years, releasing only when CipheX generates community profits. The remaining 20% follow the same lockup and vesting terms as other CPX Token holders, ensuring fairness and transparency.
2.3 Treasury Management 
CipheX utilizes multi-signature (multi-sig) authentication protocols to securely manage CPX Tokens and authorize transfers from treasury and capital wallets. CPX Tokens are digital assets under CipheX's administration, and any transfer, whether for business operations, strategic allocations, or other authorized purposes, requires multi-sig approval, ensuring security and oversight by multiple stakeholders. 
2.4 CPX Token Distribution
The token distribution drove awareness through extensive online media campaigns and strategic partnerships with established marketing firms. CipheX offered referral incentives, community engagement rewards, and exclusive benefits for contributors to drive community growth during the distribution. During this phase, CPX Token prices increased daily over 180 days, structured for an approximate 159.93% unrealized gain from the opening price.
Start Price Per CPX: $0.10 (Ten Cents)
Minimum CPX Tokens: 2000 CPX (n1)
Maximum CPX Tokens: 200,000 CPX (n1)
Target Total Contributions: $20,000,000 (n2)
Minimum Total Contributions: $2,000,000 (n3)
Planned Duration: 180 Days (extendable)


Notes: (n1) CipheX accepted USDT, USDC, and ETH for CPX Token contributions. (n2) 142,738,450 CPX Tokens were allocated for the token distribution. (n3) The token distribution had a Minimum Contribution requirement. The distribution phase has now concluded successfully.

2.5 Token Claiming Portal
Contributors can now access their CPX tokens through the token claiming portal at https://presale.ciphex.io. The portal provides a comprehensive dashboard where users can connect their wallet, view their complete vesting schedule, track all transaction records, and claim tokens monthly as they vest over the 12-month period. The portal also includes an "Add CPX to Wallet" feature for easy wallet integration with the CPX token contract.
2.6 Lockup & Vesting Restrictions
All CPX Tokens from the token distribution are subject to a six-month lockup, followed by a 12-month vesting period. Lockup began upon contribution, during which tokens accrue fixed returns based on the 10-year US Treasury yield. These returns, paid in unrestricted CPX Tokens, can be claimed through the claiming portal. After the six-month lockup, CPX Tokens enter a one-year vesting schedule, except for certain performance-locked Creator Tokens. In the first month, 3% of CPX Tokens vest, with increasing monthly releases until all tokens are fully vested within 12 calendar months.
2.7 Use of Token Distribution Proceeds
CipheX has allocated token distribution proceeds over the next 12 to 18 months to expand its decentralized ecosystem and accelerate the commercialization of its Centurion Network.
2.8 Fixed Term Staking and Rewards
The CipheX Fixed Term Staking program (CPX Staking) enables CPX Token holders to lock tokens for 6 to 12 months and earn unrestricted CPX Token rewards. Launching shortly after the token distribution, it offers fixed returns based on the 10-year US Treasury yield at the time of staking plus a premium, with rates varying by term and deposit size. For 12 months post-distribution, participants can restake CPX Tokens before the program shifts to liquidity staking incentives.

3.0 The CipheX Community
3.1 Operating Capital Reserves
CipheX expects token distribution proceeds to fund Centurion Network commercialization and generate sufficient revenue to support operations and innovation. Revenue from Centurion Network, LP trading fees, and RWA services will further sustain growth. Retained funds will be proposed annually for community approval, with mid-year reallocation votes available to address evolving priorities, ensuring financial sustainability and strategic expansion.
3.2 Eligibility for Community Voting
Token holders with a minimum of 10,000 CPX Tokens are eligible to participate in community voting activities, with each token representing one vote. Consumers holding fewer than 10,000 CPX Tokens are not eligible to vote. They will not be able to access the CipheX community governance features.
3.3 Creators & Community Contributors
The CipheX core team comprises Creators, Founding Contributors, and elected Expert Contributors with 20+ years of innovation development and 30+ years in asset management, capital markets, and executive leadership. Creators and Founding Contributors drive Centurion Network development and community engagement within the CipheX ecosystem.
3.4 Removals and Termination
Expert Contributors are nominated and elected by CipheX community members for up to two-year terms, with the option for re-election. Only community members can submit nominations for these roles. Expert and general contributors can be removed for non-performance or may exit early, with their CPX Tokens revoked and returned to the treasury. 
3.5 Pre-Launch Centurion Trading
The Centurion Capital Pool is exclusive to token contributors, providing them early access to Pre-Launch Centurion trading during Phase II of the Centurion Network. As detailed in the Use of Token Distribution Proceeds, approximately 17% of each contribution was allocated to fund the contributor's initial trading portfolio, effectively lowering the net cost of CPX Tokens acquired during the token distribution. This early access allows contributors to participate in the Centurion Network's pre-launch trading and testing activities in a live market environment, helping refine its AI-driven strategies, user experience, and overall performance.
During this phase, trading activities will reflect real market conditions, with actual potential gains or losses occurring. Contributors can redeem trading profits under specific test guidelines that will be available once this phase begins. At the same time, contributors will be responsible for anticipated network transactions and gas fees. Once the Centurion Network is commercially launched, Centurion trading fees will apply only to profitable trades. These fees will be simulated during the testing period using live market conditions. However, no actual fees will be deducted from users' trading profits. At the end of the pre-launch testing phase, the Centurion Capital Pool will close, and each trading portfolio will be returned to its respective contributor, allowing them to manage their trading portfolio independently moving forward.
3.6 Pre-Launch Loss Coverage
This loss protection coverage is also exclusive to token contributors. If the Centurion Network incurs a trading loss within the Centurion Capital Pool during the Pre-Launch Centurion Trading phase, CipheX will compensate participants with additional unrestricted CPX Tokens equal to 50% of their loss's currency value. These compensatory CPX Tokens will be claimable after the pre-launch test phase, which will last approximately six months. Once the Centurion Network becomes commercially available, this loss protection coverage will no longer be available to contributors.
3.7 Centurion Commercial Launch
Once the Centurion Network is commercially available, anyone can sign up for free and access its advanced trading features. As a noncustodial ecosystem, CipheX does not require users to open an account or deposit funds to utilize the network. However, users will need funds in their wallets to build their trading portfolio and authorize Centurions to manage their financial goals.
The Centurion Network will charge Centurion trading fees only on profitable trades, ranging from 0.10% to 0.50% per trade, calculated automatically based on trade value and volume. Additionally, regardless of profitability, Gwei (gas fees) and other third-party network transaction fees may apply to all Centurion trades.
3.8 Liquidity Pool & Trading Fees
CipheX will fund and deploy its own liquidity pool (LP) to enhance market stability and trading efficiency. For the first year following the launch of DEX trading and until liquid staking becomes available, Token Contributors will receive quarterly distributions equal to 25% of accrued trading revenues, minus gas and transaction fees ("LP Fees"). These distributions will be proportionally allocated based on each contributor's token distribution participation. After the first year, CipheX will extend the 25% LP Fee to all liquidity providers through a tiered liquidity staking rewards system, with governance mechanisms allowing for flexible adjustments as the ecosystem expands.
The remaining 75% of CipheX trading revenues from its liquidity pool will be strategically reinvested to strengthen and diversify the platform's financial structure. A portion of these funds will be used to purchase additional USDT and ETH, ensuring a healthy liquidity reserve for additional stability during market volatility. To further mitigate market-driven losses, some revenues will be invested through the Centurion Network to accumulate stable short-term assets and generate lower-risk trading revenues. Additionally, CipheX will allocate funds to ongoing technological advancements and expanding long-term growth strategies.
3.9 Distribution of Market Returns
Profits from Centurion trading activities, less any transaction fees, are automatically transferred to user wallets based on their preferences. Distributable returns from future RWA services and other financial offerings are expected to be issued annually, if available, with distribution amounts determined through community voting.
3.10 Buyback & Burn Program
The CipheX ecosystem is designed to reduce about 95% of its total token supply over the next decade through an automated annual burn, randomly announced and executed within 30 days of each annual announcement, without community vote. Alternatively, within 30 days, community members can propose a buyback-and-burn using surplus capital, if available. This alternative program requires community approval and is designed not to impact ongoing innovation or future investments.
3.11 CipheX Revenue Streams
Over the next ten years, CipheX will focus on three primary revenue streams: Centurion Network market activities, RWA tokenization and financing, and commercial peer-to-peer lending services. CipheX also plans to introduce an open-source development environment, enhancing innovation, market transparency, and interoperability to increase market adoption and expand competitive advantage beyond cryptocurrency markets.
Notes: (n1) Estimated Revenue from Centurion Network, CipheX LP Revenues, and Future Services, with EYE1 beginning upon full commercial launch of the Centurion Network; (n2) For this summary, CipheX includes investments in Non-Liquid Assets (NLA), attributed to early investments in RWA projects to be tokenized over a one-to-two-year period.
Notes: (n1) Anticipated R&D and innovation development for the Centurion Network; (n2) General operations are projected to average around 12.11% annually; and (n3) Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) expected to become available pre-tax distributable returns to the CipheX community, less proposed capital allocations approved by the CipheX community annually for ongoing innovations and market-driven strategies.

4.0 Market Risk Factors
4.1 Market and Technical Volatility
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, with rapid price swings. CipheX relies on Centurion Network's proprietary algorithms to generate returns for its consumers and community members. However, investors should know that this high-risk trading environment can sometimes result in losses. In addition, autonomous trading bots can increase market volatility if not managed properly. If the Centurion Network misinterprets market conditions, Centurions may act unpredictably, potentially resulting in significant losses. 
4.2 Market Liquidity 
Certain cryptocurrencies, especially newer or lesser-known tokens, often face low liquidity, making trades difficult at preferred prices or within short timeframes. CipheX cannot guarantee sustained liquidity or continuous demand for CPX Tokens.
4.3 Market and Price Manipulation
Low-liquidity markets are vulnerable to manipulation, including pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, and insider trading. Coordinated groups may exploit key protocols or liquidity, distorting prices, volumes, and governance. These tactics can mislead investors, cause financial losses, and threaten the integrity of the CipheX community.
4.4 Privacy and Data Vulnerabilities
CipheX employs third-party services to protect member identities. However, blockchain transactions are inherently public and can expose user details and histories. While CipheX is committed to privacy, these measures cannot guarantee indefinite protection and anonymity. In addition, smart contracts automate transactions in a decentralized environment but carry risks like coding errors and malicious exploits. These can lead to losses, transaction disruptions, and other unintended outcomes. 
4.5 Operational Risks
Blockchain networks and trading platforms can face unexpected issues, outages, or bugs. CipheX also relies on Expert Contributors for key development and operations; their departure or inability to perform could significantly disrupt community operations. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires can disrupt the services of the CipheX community, causing power outages and internet interruptions that may delay transactions, compromise networks, and lead to financial losses.
