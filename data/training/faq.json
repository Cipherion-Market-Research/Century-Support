  "Lockups & Vesting": [
    {
      "question": "What is a Lockup?",
      "answer": "A lockup is a period during which a contributor's CPX Tokens are not available for trading. The lockup was a crucial aspect of the CipheX token distribution, as it ensures that the token price remains stable and prevents market manipulation. The lockup period is designed to protect all contributors' interests and maintain the integrity of the tokenomics. All CPX tokens are subject to the same lockup and vesting schedule, to be fair to all participants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Lockup Period?",
      "answer": "All CPX Tokens are subject to a six-month lockup period and a one-year vesting schedule after the six-month lockup is complete. The lockup period started immediately after your CPX token purchase and is managed by smart contracts. Lockup Earnings: You earn a fixed rate of return on the value of your locked CPX Tokens. The lockup rate of return is equivalent to the yield rate of the 10-year US Treasury, determined at the start of the token distribution. Interest is paid in unrestricted CPX Tokens, which are claimable at the end of the lockup period."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Vesting Schedule?",
      "answer": "A vesting schedule outlines the distribution of a contributor's CPX Tokens over a specific period. It ensures a gradual release of tokens to contributors, preventing a sudden influx that could destabilize the token price. Vesting Highlights: Duration: One-year vesting schedule. Distribution Pattern: First Month: 3% of your tokens will become claimable. Subsequent Months: Vesting rates increase incrementally each month. Completion: All CPX tokens are fully vested within 12-months. Example: If you have 100,000 CPX tokens released from lockup: First Month: 3,000 tokens vest. Following Months: Vesting amounts increase each month until all 100,000 tokens are vested by the end of the one-year period."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I earn interest on my locked CPX tokens?",
      "answer": "Yes, you earn a fixed rate of return on the value of your locked CPX Tokens. The lockup rate of return is equivalent to the yield rate of the 10-year US Treasury, determined on the date the CipheX token distribution began."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Creator Tokens have a Lockup and Vesting Schedule?",
      "answer": "Eighty percent (80%) of tokens are subject to a two-year lock-up period and will adhere to the same six-month lock-up and one-year vesting schedule applied to all CPX Token holders. This alignment reinforces principles of fairness, transparency, and equitable treatment."

  "Exchange Listing": [
    {
      "question": "Will CipheX be listed on Centralized Exchanges?",
      "answer": "Not immediately. Our focus is on building a robust, decentralized community and ecosystem. We believe that by remaining independent, we can maintain greater control over our tokenomics, operations, and long-term vision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where will CipheX be listed?",
      "answer": "Following the completion of our token distribution phase, CipheX CPX Token will launch on Uniswap, our preferred decentralized exchange (DEX) platform. After our initial listing, we will focus on establishing market value and demonstrating the functionality of our Market Centurions. As demand for our tokens increases, we will pursue centralized exchanges (CEX) listings to further enhance accessibility, market value, and liquidity for CipheX's Community Members. Once we have finalized our listing strategy, we will make an announcement on our official channels."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is your regulatory compliance strategy?",
      "answer": "CipheX actively monitors regulatory developments in cryptocurrency and intends to comply with evolving standards. However, cryptocurrency markets exist within a dynamic regulatory landscape, where changes in laws, regulations, or policies across regions could impact market access, trading practices, and the legality of certain crypto assets. Additionally, regulatory crackdowns or bans could pose risks to the value and liquidity of digital assets, potentially affecting investors."
