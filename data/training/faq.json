  "Lockups & Vesting": [
    {
      "question": "What is a Lockup?",
      "answer": "A lockup is a period during which a contributor's CPX Tokens are not available for trading. The lockup is a crucial aspect of the CipheX PreSale, as it ensures that the token price remains stable and prevents market manipulation.

The lockup period starts immediately after your CPX PreSale purchase and is managed by smart contracts. Lockup Earnings: You will earn a fixed rate of return on the value of your locked CPX Tokens. The lockup rate of return is equivalent to the yield rate of the 10-year US Treasury, determined at the start of the PreSale. Interest will be paid in unrestricted CPX Tokens, which are claimable at the end of the lockup period."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Vesting Schedule?",
      "answer": "A vesting schedule outlines the distribution of a contributor's CPX Tokens over a specific period. It ensures a gradual release of tokens to PreSale buyers, preventing a sudden influx that could destabilize the token price. Vesting Highlights: Duration: One-year vesting schedule. Distribution Pattern: First Month: 3% of your tokens will become claimable. Subsequent Months: Vesting rates increase incrementally each month. Completion: All CPX tokens are fully vested within 12-months. Example: If you have 100,000 CPX tokens released from lockup: First Month: 3,000 tokens vest. Following Months: Vesting amounts increase each month until all 100,000 tokens are vested by the end of the one-year period."

    {
      "question": "Do I earn interest on my locked CPX tokens?",

      "question": "Is this Fund an 80/20/2 structure for management?",
      "answer": "No, there is no centralized fund management team or chief investment officer. 100% of the profits generated from Centurion market activities can be distributed to CipheX Community Members (Members) if the majority of voters choose to vote for it. However, doing so would conflict with the purpose of CipheX as an open community fund, which is designed to allocate portions of its profits towards operations, and future Social Investments and Community Programs. Governance Features: Once the Market Centurions are deployed, we plan to launch our Community Governance feature, enabling CipheX Community Members to vote on proposed profit distributions. These votes will cover key areas such as: Funding for operations, Development, Security, Other essential expenses required to maintain the community's efficiency.
